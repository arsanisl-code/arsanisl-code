# Hi, I'm Arsani Rizk

Computer Engineering student at Folsom Lake College, working toward transfer to a UC engineering program. I build things with C++ and Python, with a focus on writing clean, modern code and using available resources to produce code more efficiently while ensuring I can understand and defend  my code line by line.
